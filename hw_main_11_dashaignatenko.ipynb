Правильность ответов не так важна, так как вы скорее всего будете использовать небольшие модели, но текст должен быть не рандомным.\n",

        "Русскоязычный датасет инструкций должен быть больше 5 тысяч примеров. Он может быть основнован на alpaca/dolly (например, вы можете просто прогнать все через переводную модель, которая была на семинаре, или даже google translate). Или вы можете придумать способ создать аналогичный датасет каким-то другим способом (переделать открытые датасеты с помощью правил). Датасет может быть не уникальным, можно скооперироваться с одногруппниками и сделать один датасет на всех.\n",

Потом начинайте вращать шарик между ладонями, чтоб сформировался цилиндр. Затем используйте пальцы, чтобы создать стенки горшка высотой и диаметром по желанию.\\n\\n3.

Для этого, воспользуйтесь ножом или другим инструментом для делания отверстия на дне горшка.\\n\\n4. Высушить горшок: дайте горшку высохнуть на протяжении 24 часов при комнатной температуре.\\n\\n5. Обжиг горшка: после того как горшок высохнет, следует обжечь его на термостойкой поверхности, такой как плавленное стекло или кирпич. Это нужно сделать, чтобы горшок стал крепче.
